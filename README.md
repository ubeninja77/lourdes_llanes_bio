<p>Lourdes recently moved to Seattle, WA from San Francisco, CA, a city she's called home for over 20 years. Originally from Chicago, Il, she's always known she'd make her way to Washington state. Unbeknownst to her, it would be to pursue her dream career in the technology field.
</p>
    
<p>Before pursuing a career in technology, Lourdes was a Practice Manager a pet hospital for 8 years and most recently an assistant recruiter for a start-up company.
</p>
     
<p>Thanks to the endless hiking trails and abundant outdoor activities California has to offer, Lourdes' weekends were filled with hugging Redwood trees and exploring the California coastline. She hopes to explore the PNW with the same passion for adventure. </p>
